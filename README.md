# Campus Voices (Backend)

This application is designed for university communities to foster conversations about any events or issues occurring on campus. The platform allows students, faculty, and staff to share experiences, concerns, or problems they encounter, encouraging mutual support among community members. Additionally, it provides universities with valuable insights into the most pressing issues affecting the campus, helping them address and improve the overall student experience. The goal is to create a collaborative environment where people can discuss and solve problems together, enhancing communication and awareness across the university.
